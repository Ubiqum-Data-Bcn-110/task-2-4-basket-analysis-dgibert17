#### OBJECTIVES ####
## You will be discovering any interesting relationships (or associations) between customer’s #
      #transactions and the item(s) they’ve purchased. These associations can then be used to drive
      #sales-oriented initiatives such as recommender systems like the ones used by Amazon and
      #other eCommerce sites. 
## Are there any interesting patterns or item relationships within Electronidex's transactions?
## Would Blackwell benefit from selling any of Electronidex's items?
## In your opinion, should Blackwell acquire Electronidex?
## If Blackwell does acquire Electronidex, do you have any recommendations for Blackwell?
      #(Ex: cross-selling items, sale promotions, should they remove items, etc.)#
